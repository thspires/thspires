My name is Tiago H. S. Pires.
I’m interested in all aspects of data analysis, from databases to statistics and machine learning.
I have over 10 years of experience working with large datasets generated by computer vision (object tracking) and ecological surveys of fish in the Amazon.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of data science project
